# SA2 Quick Save Reloader

Place the "sa2-quick-save-reload" folder from the zip inside your "mods" folder, then enable it in the SA2 Mod Manager.<br/>
**Make sure to configure the mod before running, otherwise it won't work.**<br/>
The configuration tooltips should tell you what the settings do but ask if you are having problems.

Quick troubleshooting: if the mod doesn't load, download and install the latest 2015-2022 x86 VC++ redist [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
